## The one engine

All selling prices — dashboard preview, extension scan, eBay upload, dashboard
import, re-import, variants — are produced by **one formula** with **one
settings source**:

| Piece | File | Runtime |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical engine | `apps/extension/suppliers/core/pricing-core.js` (`SSPricingCore`) | extension (bundles + panels) |
| Server copy (generated) | `supabase/functions/_shared/pricing-core.js` — written by `apps/extension/scripts/sync-pricing-core.js`; **never hand-edit** | Deno edge functions |
| Dashboard mirror | `apps/web/src/lib/pricing-calculator.ts` — TS mirror for the live preview; backend remains authoritative | web app |
| Rule application (extension) | `apps/extension/common/pricing-apply.js` (`SSPricingApply`) — the only module allowed to stamp `finalPrice`/`ebayPrice` on scraped products | extension |
| Rule resolution + server pricing | `supabase/functions/_shared/pricing-service.ts` — resolves the authenticated user's rule, validates input, computes, returns an auditable breakdown | Deno edge functions |

Settings live in **`user_pricing_settings`** (one row per user per supplier,
RLS-enforced, `rule_version` bumped on every save, `formula_version` selecting
v1 legacy / v2 sale-based math, `per_order_fee` for eBay's fixed fee). They
are edited in the dashboard at **Dashboard → eBay → Supplier Pricing**
(`CalculatorSettings.tsx` → `pricing-settings` edge function).

There is deliberately **no pricing formula** in: supplier adapters, content
scripts, the background worker, React components, controllers, or DB triggers.
`ui/calculator.js` is a what-if popup only; a price applied from it travels as
an explicit manual override.

## Formula versions and deterministic rule order

All math in integer cents. Parsing happens once at entry, display formatting
once at exit. Rounding never reduces the price. The version lives on each
`user_pricing_settings` row (`formula_version`) and is stamped into every
stored breakdown, so any listing can be traced to the exact math that priced
it.

### v2 — sale-based gross-up (default for new users, recommended)

eBay charges its final value fee as a **percentage of the sale price plus a
fixed per-order fee** (~13.25% + $0.30 for most categories). v2 models exactly
that, so the profit a user configures is the profit actually realized:

```
1. totalCost   = supplierPrice + shippingCost + shippingBuffer + fixedHandlingFee
2. pctOfSale   = marketplaceFeePercent + currencyBufferPercent      // % of FINAL price
   denominator = 1 − pctOfSale/100      // rejected when ≤ 0.25 → FEES_TOO_HIGH
3. price       = max( ceil((totalCost × (1 + profitMarginPercent%) + perOrderFee) / denominator),   // profit = markup on cost
                      ceil((totalCost + perOrderFee + minimumProfit) / denominator) )               // minimum REALIZED profit
4. finalPrice  = applyRounding(price)   // NONE | END_99 | END_95 | END_49 | ROUND_UP
                 // bump-verified: realized profit ≥ target even across
                 // per-component fee-rounding boundaries
5. realizedProfit = finalPrice − round(finalPrice×mkt%) − round(finalPrice×fx%)
                    − perOrderFee − totalCost      // ≥ target by construction
```

Worked example ($10 cost, 20% profit, 13.25% + $0.30): v2 lists **$14.18** and
realizes **exactly $2.00** after fees. The same settings under v1 list $13.30
and realize only ~$1.24 after real eBay fees — the shortfall v2 exists to fix.

### v1 — legacy additive (existing rules, preserved exactly)

```
1. baseCost        = supplierPrice + shippingCost + shippingBuffer + fixedHandlingFee
2. marketplaceFee  = round(baseCost × marketplaceFeePercent%)     // fee on COST — understates real fees
3. currencyBuffer  = round(baseCost × currencyBufferPercent%)
4. targetProfit    = max(round(baseCost × profitMarginPercent%), minimumProfit)
5. rawFinal        = baseCost + marketplaceFee + currencyBuffer + targetProfit
6. finalPrice      = applyRounding(rawFinal)
```

v1 stays bit-identical for every existing rule (locked by regression tests).
Existing users see an **opt-in upgrade banner** on the Supplier Pricing page
with a side-by-side price preview; switching bumps `rule_version` and
propagates to the extension immediately. `per_order_fee` exists on every row
but is inert under v1.

Invalid input (missing/zero/negative/NaN price, unsupported currency,
fees ≥ guardrail) throws — **a product is never silently priced from a
fabricated cost or an absurd gross-up.** (The legacy engine's `$50` default is
gone.)

Currency: only `USD` sources are supported today. Non-USD raw prices are
rejected with `UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCY` — no FX rate is ever guessed. When
conversion ships, it must happen exactly once, before step 1, with the rate +
timestamp recorded in the breakdown.

      • resolves the AUTHENTICATED user's rule server-side (never a body userId)
      • recomputes the price from the RAW supplier price
      • draft/import writes: server value is persisted (authoritative)
      • post-upload writes (real ebay_item_id): eBay price recorded as reality,
        expected price + drift stored for audit (admin_audit_logs on >1¢ drift)

      ▼

      • raw supplier data:   supplier, supplier_product_id, supplier_url,
                             supplier_price, supplier_currency, raw_supplier_price
      • calculated result:   ebay_price / final_price
      • audit trail:         pricing_breakdown (jsonb), pricing_rule_version,
                             price_calculated_at, pricing_drift_cents, price_source
```

Raw supplier prices are **never overwritten** by calculated values, and
re-pricing always starts from the raw price — re-imports can never compound
markup (locked by `tests/pricing-apply.test.js`).

### `price_source` vocabulary

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `calculated` | Produced by the pricing engine from the user's active rule |
| `manual` | Explicit user override — engine and server both leave it alone |
| `ebay_upload` | Recorded from the live eBay listing post-upload |
| `client` | Legacy payload without supplier data (e.g. eBay-side sync) |
| `client_unverified` | Client value kept because server pricing was unavailable (rule disabled, unsupported currency) — logged |

## API contract (create-listing)

Request additions (all optional, legacy Amazon-named fields still accepted):

```jsonc
{
  "supplier": "walmart",              // validated against known supplier keys
  "supplier_id": "123456",            // supplier product id
  "supplier_url": "https://www.walmart.com/ip/123456",
  "supplier_price": 12.50,            // RAW supplier price (never the selling price)
  "supplier_currency": "USD",
  "supplier_shipping_cost": 2.00,
  "price_source": "calculated",      // or "manual" for explicit overrides
  "variations": [{ "sku": "…", "raw_supplier_price": 8.00, "final_price": 0, "price_source": null }]
}
```

Behavior: with a resolvable supplier + raw price and no manual flag, the server
recomputes `ebay_price` and every variation `final_price` from raw prices with
the user's active rule, stores the breakdown, and audits drift vs. any
client-sent price. A payload that requests calculation but has no valid price
and no client fallback is rejected with HTTP 422 (`INVALID_SUPPLIER_PRICE`,
`UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCY`, …) — nothing is saved.

## Settings changes propagate

1. Dashboard save → `pricing-settings` PUT bumps `rule_version`, `updated_at`.
2. `CalculatorSettings.tsx` posts `SS_PRICING_RULES_UPDATED` → `bridge.js` →
   `FORCE_PRICING_SYNC` → `pricing-rule-sync.js` refreshes the cache (ETag).
3. Panel open triggers the same forced sync; a 10-minute alarm is the backstop.
4. `panel-main.js` re-prices the current product when the cache changes.
5. Server-side, every import resolves the rule fresh from the DB — an
   extension with stale rules produces a logged drift and the server value
   wins on draft/import writes.

Existing products are **not** silently recalculated when settings change
(deliberate — see Remaining work).

## Database

Migration `20260711100000_central_pricing_authority.sql` (additive, idempotent,
rollback documented in the file header):

* `listings` + supplier-neutral raw columns, pricing audit columns, provenance
  flags (`price_source`, `title_source`, `description_source`, `sku_source` —
  these were being sent by the extension and silently dropped before).
* `listing_variations` + `price_source`, `pricing_rule_version`.
* Backfill: `supplier='amazon'`, `supplier_product_id=amazon_asin`,
  `supplier_url=amazon_url`, `supplier_price=amazon_price` where inferable.
* `idx_listings_user_supplier_pid` for idempotent non-Amazon imports.
* `create_listing_with_variations` RPC replaced with a strict superset
  (same ON CONFLICT semantics, return shape unchanged; adds the new columns +
  supplier-neutral dedupe when no ASIN).

Schema invariants are locked by `supabase/tests/pricing_authority_test.sql`
(pgTAP, `supabase test db`).

## Tests

| Suite | Command | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Engine math | `node --test apps/extension/tests/pricing-core.test.js` | cents parsing, rounding rules, formula |
| Rule application | `node --test apps/extension/tests/pricing-apply.test.js` | user isolation, settings changes, re-import safety, manual overrides, no fabricated prices |
| Scan parity | `node --test apps/extension/tests/scan-pricing-parity.test.js` | every injector delegates to SSPricingApply; bundles include the engine |
| E2E pipeline | `node --test apps/extension/tests/e2e-simulation.test.js` | scrape → price → adapt → upload validation |
| Server pricing | `deno test supabase/functions/_shared/pricing-service.test.ts` | server computation, input validation, supplier inference |
| Schema | `supabase test db` (`pricing_authority_test.sql`) | raw/calculated separation, RLS, indexes |

## Remaining work (explicitly out of scope here)

* **Recalculate existing products** — an explicit, user-triggered batch action
  (select own products → reprice from stored `supplier_price` with latest
  rule → audit). The data model now supports it (`supplier_price`,
  `pricing_rule_version`).
* **Currency conversion** — adapters should extract source currency; the
  service rejects non-USD until a real FX source exists.
* **eBay price update-back** — when a draft price drifts from a live eBay
  listing, surface it in the dashboard rather than only in audit logs.
